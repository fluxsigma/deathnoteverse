    <h1>Light Yagami</h1>
    <p>Light Yagami (夜神月, Yagami Raito) is the main protagonist of the Death Note series. After discovering the Death
        Note, he decides to use it to rid the world of criminals. His killings are eventually labelled by the people
        living in Japan as the work of "Kira."
    </p>
    <h3>CHARACTER</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive and good with problem
        solving skills, Light is a skilled planner and good at mapping out scenarios. Furthermore, Light is very popular
        among peers and adored by his family members. However, his high intelligence and constant praise from adults
        laid the foundation for an intense level of hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.
        <br><br><br>

        Similar to his father Soichiro, Light has a strong sense of justice but this quickly becomes warped after he
        becomes tainted by the notebook's power. Believing the world to be "rotten," he uses his Death Note as a means
        by which he can enact his will to rid the world of evil people. Light's main goal is to create a new world that
        is free of injustice and populated only with people whom he deems honest and kind, thus becoming the "God of the
        new world". Light is decisive and driven to achieve his ambitions, without faltering one bit in his beliefs.
        Despite knowing the criminality of murder, Light would consider his actions the ultimate “sacrifice” to help the
        world.

        Through use of the Death Note, Light quickly begins to develop a cold and ruthless nature. As a utilitarian, he
        will take any means in order to achieve his goals. However, though his actions do put his family in harm's way,
        he continues to show love and genuine concern for them. This is demonstrated when his sister Sayu is kidnapped
        and held for ransom; Light prevents Soichiro from taking drastic action in order to keep Sayu safe in spite of
        knowingly increasing Mello's chances of obtaining the Death Note.
    </p>

    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Light grew up in Japan with his family, which consists of his father, Soichiro Yagami, who is a member of the
        Japanese Task Force (an investigation team opposing Kira), his mother, Sachiko Yagami, and his younger sister,
        Sayu Yagami.<br><br><br>

        At the start of the series, Light is a third-year high school student (12th Grade) at Daikoku Private Academy
        and also attends supplemental classes at Gamou Prep Academy in the beginning of the story. He later attends
        college at To-Oh University (東応大学, Tōō Daigaku).
