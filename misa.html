<h1>Misa Amane (弥 海砂, Amane Misa)</h1>
<p>Misa Amane (弥 海砂, Amane Misa) is an up-and-coming model, actress, and supporter of Kira who eventually becomes the Second Kira. After gaining a Death Note, she seeks out Kira in order to thank him for killing the man who murdered her family and to offer him her help. Having made the trade for the Shinigami Eyes, Misa learns that the identity of Kira is Light Yagami. After a meeting with Light, she decides to dedicate her life to helping Light however she can, and becomes determined to use her eyes to uncover L's real name.
</p>
<h3>CHARACTER</h3><hr>
<p>Misa is very outgoing and is shown to be quite popular due to her career. She attracts a large crowd while visiting Light near his school.[5] She is hyperactive, impulsive, and otherwise childlike, evidenced by her tendency to speak in the third person. Despite being considered idiotic by many, Misa is shown to have moments of intelligence, such as when she successfully tricks Kyosuke Higuchi into revealing himself to be the Yotsuba Kira.[6] However, Misa possesses the shinigami eyes, which allow her to see a person's name and lifespan above their head, making it much easier to kill people with the Death Note. She is very careless in her acts as the Second Kira, which leads to her being arrested and put in confinement on suspicion that she is is the second Kira. As she likely didn't know the Death Note could manipulate victims, and thus mailed the tapes herself; failed to ensure there was no DNA on the envelopes she sent the tapes in; completely ignored Light's order to stay away (as he was already suspected of being Kira) as he predicted L was having him followed.
    <br><br><br>
    Although she is generally nice to those she meets, she can also be quite cruel: she tells Light that she would kill any other girls he dates,[7] despite said girls being part of his plan to appear as a normal young man to the investigators and deflect suspicion from himself and Misa.
    
    Despite her typically cheerful personality, Misa has been mentally afflicted by seeing her parents murdered right before her eyes. It is unclear how much the trauma has affected Misa psychologically, but in the films, Rem indicates that Misa went through a deep depression immediately after she discovered the murderer was acquitted of the crime. After the murderer is later killed by Kira, Misa is incredibly grateful, and her intense appreciation and hero-worship initially fuels her actions as the Second Kira. After she becomes emotionally attached to Light, her behavior is strongly motivated by love.
    
    Light Yagami is an important figure in Misa's life, and she frequently comments on him being so, often declaring her love for him despite little reciprocation. She is faithful to Light to the point of refusing to perform a kiss with fellow actor Hideki Ryuga while making a film out of her fidelity. After losing her memories of the Death Note for the first time, she even decides to help catch Kira, whom she views as the avenger of her family, for Light (who has joined the Task Force for the investigation of Kira case and also creating an alibi for yourself).<br><br><br>

    <h3>HISTORY</h3><hr>
    <p> 
        A year before the start of the series, Misa witnessed the murder of her family during an attempted home robbery. The trial against her parents' murderer continued over a long stretch of time, during which opinions that he was falsely accused began to surface. After he was killed by Kira, Misa felt justice had been served, prompting her to become a loyal Kira supporter.

One night, shortly after beginning her modeling career, Misa met an obsessed, knife-wielding stalker. He confessed his feelings to Misa, but upon her rejection, he attacked and attempted to kill her. A Shinigami named Gelus, who had been watching Misa from the Shinigami Realm and had fallen in love with her, wrote down the name of her stalker and killed him, ultimately saving Misa's life.

Since Shinigami are meant to shorten human lifespans and not extend them, Gelus himself died, turning to dust and leaving behind only his Death Note. Since Misa was meant to die, but was saved by Gelus, her lifespan was ultimately extended in the process. Another Shinigami, Rem, witnessed the sacrifice and decided that Gelus' notebook should belong to Misa in accordance with Gelus' wishes. After giving Misa the Death Note, Rem was obligated to stay with her (as Ryuk is with Light), and Rem eventually develops feelings for her over time as Gelus did. In the hope of meeting and thanking Kira for avenging her parents, Misa made the eye deal with Rem, she uses this ability to track down Light Yagami.    </p>
