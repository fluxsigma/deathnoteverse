                writing the
                victim's name while picturing their face. The story follows his attempts to become a god by creating a
                New World
                cleansed of evil, using the notebook, and the complex conflict between himself and all those who try to

        <p class="plot">In a world where the feeling of being lonely amongst a crowd is prevalent, a guy named Light
            Yagami stumbles upon an odd black book, the <strong>Death Note</strong> which belongs to a Shinigami- a God
            of
            Death. The death note has the power to end lives if the name of a person is written in it while looking at
            him/her. The Shinigami that owns this death note has dropped it on purpose in order to see how the mortals
            will
            use it and what happens next becomes a series that stays with you, days after watching it. After a few days
            of
            getting the Death Note, Light is visited by Ryuk and he cannot be seen by anyone except the one who has
            touched
            the Death Note. Ryuk reveals the reason for dropping the note and it turns out to be nothing but boredom.
            <br><br>
            Following these events, we come to see the various reports about the death of a number of criminals around
            the
            world. The cause of death is extremely vague as the criminals around the world are perishing due to
            heart-attacks and accidents and the media terms the deaths to be planned by a single mastermind, Kira, which
            literally translates to <strong>killer</strong> in Japanese.
            <br><br>The law enforcement agencies and the public cozied up to Kira but the Interpol looks out for the
            assistance of L, an enigmatic and highly esteemed detective. L tracks down Kira stage a TV broadcast and
            tracks
            down Light Yagami to be in the Kanto region of Japan. Light is infuriated by this and vows to kill L as he
            is a
            hindrance to the execution of his plans and whilst all this L is trying to piece everything and determines
            that
            Light Yagami is the prime suspect. Graduation comes along for Light and after school is over Light is
            inducted
            into Kira Task Force set up by L.
